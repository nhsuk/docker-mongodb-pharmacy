# docker-mongodb-pharmacy

This is a repo for our docker MongoDB images + data (there are 2 sample files in the `data` directory )

# Development

* From within the directory run `docker-compose up --build` to run the app (you will need to have installed Docker for your OS).
* RoboMongo is a good free GUI client for viewing MongoDB db's.
* Connect to the MongoDB instance from a MongoDB client on `localhost:27017`.
